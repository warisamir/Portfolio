## Features

-   All of the personal information is populated from the resume.json file following the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) standard, a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. Discover the official schema [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema).
-   The toggle/switch for the dark mode syncs its state to the local storage.

#### Coming soon

-   Two beautiful resume page templates generated based on the data in the resume.json file -- a modern approach of the traditional printed CV.
